# ActionsTest

A project to test using C++/CMake/? with github actions.

##Goals:
Goals include but are not limited to:
- [x] Compilation
- [ ] clang-tidy?
- [ ] include what you use?
- [ ] linting
- [x] testing
- [ ] fuzzing
- [ ] code coverage  
- [x] multiple compilers
- [x] multiple build options (DEBUG vs RELEASE)
- [x] multiple build options and compilers
- [ ] ccache
- [ ] other caches?
- [ ] Ignoring markdown (documentation) changes only  
   This does lead to "missing" builds so may not actually be great (maybe ignore on `devel` / `main`?)
